## SEMT_SMT_Benchmarks

ISCAS 85 benchmarks with timing and layout information for SEMT_SMT_Analysis tool.

All benchmarks are synthesized at 45 nanometer technology using the NCSU FreePDK45 technology library.

```
Each folder contains

  1. The design file (.v)
  2. Design constraint file (.sdc)
  3. Standard delay file (.sdf)
  4. Layout information (.def, .sdf)
```
  
The designs were synthesized using Synopsys Design Compiler.

The layout is generated using Cadence Encounter SOC.
